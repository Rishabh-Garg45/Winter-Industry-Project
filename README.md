# Extracting Structured Data from Unstructured Text

## Project Overview

This repository contains the project report and training dataset for the **Winter Industrial Project** undertaken with **Tiger Analytics**. The project focuses on developing a robust pipeline for extracting structured data from unstructured text. It integrates cutting-edge technologies such as YOLOv8, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Question-Answering (QA) systems.

## Features
- **YOLOv8 for Bounding Box Detection**: Detects key text regions in complex document layouts.
- **OCR**: Extracts text from detected regions with multi-column support.
- **NER**: Identifies entities like people, organizations, and locations using domain-specific models.
- **Question-Answering**: Provides query-based retrieval of information from processed documents.

## Repository Structure
- **`/report/`**: Final project report in PDF format.
- **`/training_dataset/`**: Unstructured text dataset used for training the YOLOv8 model.

## Confidentiality Notice
The code for this project is confidential and is not included in this repository. For academic or research inquiries, please contact.

## Results
The results are discussed in the project report. Key achievements include:
- High accuracy in bounding box detection and OCR tasks.
- Effective extraction of entities using NER.
- QA system with strong performance on straightforward queries.
